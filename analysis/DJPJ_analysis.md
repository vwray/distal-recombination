This document contains details on the analysis I have run on the DJ and PJ regions.

## DJ
### Getting Trees
* This script has been run on sections of the DJ to generate 5 trees: `/data/Phillippy2/projects/acro_comparisons/hprc/distal/extract_regions/DJ/run_iqtree_sections.sh`
* The trees are located in this directory: `/data/Phillippy2/projects/acro_comparisons/hprc/distal/extract_regions/DJ/50random/mafft` with names like `mafft_DJ_1-10000.aln.treefile` and `mafft_DJ_10000-20000.aln.treefile`, where leaves have been renamed to include population, etc in file names like `extract_regions/DJ/50random/mafft/mafft_DJ_1-10000_copy.aln.treefile`. Tree files are in Newick format.
